Q1. arrange while
You want to find the first n natural even numbers. In what sequence should the following statements be rearranged to get the desired output?
Assume that suitable indentation will be included.
1. if i%2 ==0:
2. i=2
3. print(i)
4. while (i<=2*n):
5. i+=1

Q2. Even Game
Problem Description
Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from the user.
Note: Use while-loop OR for-loop, according to session flow.

Note: You can use int(input()) for obtaining user input of number N.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000000
Input Format

A single line representing N
Output Format

All even numbers from 1 to N are separated by spaces.
Example Input

Input 1:
5

Input 2:
10
Example Output

Output 1:
2 4 

Output 2:
2 4 6 8 10
Example Explanation

Sample 1:
2 4
The even numbers between 1 to 5 are 2 and 4. So the numbers 2 and 4 are printed separated by space.

Output 2:
2 4 6 8 10
The even numbers between 1 to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. So the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are printed separated by space.

Q3. Print perfect squares
Problem Description

Take an input of a number A from the user. Print all perfect squares less than or equal to A.
Note - Perfect squares are integers whose square root is an integer. (For Example: 16 is perfect square as âˆš16 = 4, or 42 = 16)



Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 104




Input Format

A single line consisting of a integer A.




Output Format

Print perfect squares less than or equal to A in a single line in a space-separated manner.



Example Input

Input 1:





20
Input 2:

100


Example Output

Output 1:





1 4 9 16
Output 2:

1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100

Q4. for loop output
What will be the output of the following code:

for i in range(-6, -10, -1):
     print(i, end =" ")
Q5. Summation Game
Problem Description

Write a program to find sum all Natural numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000



Input Format

A single line representing N



Output Format

A single integer showing sum of all Natural numbers from 1 to N



Example Input

Input 1:


5
Input 2:


10


Example Output

Output 1:


15
Output 2:

55


Q6. Multiples of 4 new
Problem Description
Given an integer input N, print all multiples of 4 less than or equal to N.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 10000


Input Format

Single line containing an integer N.


Output Format

Space separated integers representing multiples of 4 less than or equal to N.


Example Input

22


Example Output

4 8 12 16 20


Example Explanation

1 * 4 = 4
2 * 4 = 8
3 * 4 = 12
4 * 4 = 16
5 * 4 = 20

All are multiples of 4 less than 22
