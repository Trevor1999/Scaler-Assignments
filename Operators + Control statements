Q4. Spammer Trouble
Problem Description
A group of spammers is troubling Varun by calling on his mobile phone repeatedly. After a while, Varun observed a pattern that the mobile number from which the spammers call him is always lesser than his mobile number when compared on the number line. The mobile number of Varun is 1234880990. Given a mobile number as an input print True if the number belongs to the spammers else False.
Input Format
The input will be a single integer representing a mobile number.
Output Format
The output would be True if the condition holds else False
Sample Input
9999999999
Sample Output
False
Note: All the mobile numbers in this problem are hypothetical

Q5. String Concatenation Python
What is the result of the following expression in Python?
print("54" + "23")

Q6. Find modulo
Problem Description
Write a program that takes input 2 integers A and B, and returns A%B.
Input Format
First line takes input of integer A
Second line takes input of integer B
Output Format
Return the required value
Example Input
10
3
Example Output
1
Example Explanation
10 % 3 = 1. When we divide 10 by 3, the remainder is 1.

Q7. Angles Of Valid Triangle?
Problem Description
You are given 3 integer angles(in degrees) A, B and C of a triangle. You have to tell whether the triangle is valid or not.
A triangle is valid if sum of its angles equals to 180.
NOTE: You have to take the input of 3 sides of triangle from the user.
Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B, C <= 180
Input Format
First line of the input contains an integer A.
Second line of the input contains an integer B.
Third line of the input contains an integer C.
Output Format
Print 1 if the triangle having given sides is valid, else print 0.
Example Input
Input 1:
 60
 60
 60
Input 2:
 30
 40
 50
Example Output
Output 1:
 1 
Output 2:
 0 
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Sum of angles = A + B + C = 60 + 60 + 60 = 180
Hence, the given triangle is valid.
Explanation 2:
Sum of angles = A + B + C = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120
As sum of angles is not equal to 180, the given triangle is not valid.

Q8. Profit Or Loss
Problem Description
You are given the Cost Price C and Selling Price S of a Product. You have to tell whether there is a Profit or Loss. Also, calculate total profit or loss.
NOTE: It is guaranteed that Cost Price and Selling Price are not equal.
NOTE: You have to take input of the Cost Price(C) and Selling Price(S) from the user.
Problem Constraints
1 <= C, S <= 109
C ≠ S
Input Format
First line of the input contains a single integer C.
Second line of the input contains a single integer S.
Output Format
Print two integers in separate lines.
First integer denotes whether there is a profit or loss. If there is a profit, print 1, else print -1.
Second integer is a non-negative integer denoting the absolute value of total profit or loss.
Example Input
Input 1:
 2
 4
Input 2:
 4
 1
Example Output
Output 1:
 1
 2
Output 2:
 -1
 3
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Cost Price = 2
 Selling Price = 4
 As Cost Price < Selling Price, there is a profit.
 Total Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 4 - 2 = 2
Explanation 2:
 Cost Price = 4
 Selling Price = 1
 As Cost Price > Selling Price, there is a loss.
 Total Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price = 4 - 1 = 3 

Q9. Max of two
Problem Description
Write a program to input two numbers(A & B) from user and print the maximum element among A & B.
Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 1000000
1 <= B <= 1000000
Input Format
First line is a single integer A.
Second line is a single integer B.
Output Format
One line containing the greater integer A or B.
Example Input
Input 1:
5 
6
Input 2:
1000 
10000
Example Output
Output 1:
6
Output 2:
10000
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Clearly, among 5 and 6, 6 is maximum.
Explanation 2:
Clearly, among 1000 and 10000, 10000 is maximum.
